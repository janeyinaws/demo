    "### Tension between process execution and model improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw when setting up the pipeline in the last notebook, there's a **post-processing step** after the ML model - whose purpose is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To consolidate consecutive `WORD`s of the same class into a single \"entity\" detection via a simple heuristic\n",
    "- To apply (configurable) business rules to consolidate entity detections into \"fields\" on the document (e.g. selecting a single value from multiple possible matches, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these processes are implemented in a simple Python Lambda function, and so would be technically straightforward to port into the ML model endpoint itself (in [src/inference.py](src/inference.py)). However, it's the **second one** that's important.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any use case where there's a non-trivial **gap** between what the model is trained to estimate and what the business process consumes, there's a **tension** in the review process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reviewing business process fields is efficient, but does not collect model training data (although it may help us understand overall accuracy)\n",
    "2. Reviewing the model inputs & outputs directly collects training data, but:\n",
    "    - Does not directly review the accuracy of the end-to-end business process, so requires complete trust in the post-processing rules\n",
    "    - May be inefficient, as the reviewer needs to collect more information than the business process absolutely requires (e.g. having to highlight every instance of `Provider Name` in the doc, when the business process just needs to know what the name is)\n",
    "3. Splitting the review into multiple stages collects training/accuracy data for both components (ML model and business rules), but requires even more time - especially if the hand-off between the review stages might be asynchronous\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases the efficiency of the live process is most important for customer experience and cost management, and so approach 1 is taken (as we will in this example): With collection of additional model training data handled as an additional background task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases it may be possible to fully close the gap to resolve the tension and make a single offline-annotation/online-review UI work for everybody... E.g. for the credit cards use case, we might be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (Add effort) Move from word classification to a **sequence-to-sequence model**, to support more complex output processing (like OCR error correction, field format standardization, grouping words into matches, etc)... *OR*\n",
    "- (Reduce scope) **Focus only on use-cases** where:\n",
    "    - Each entity class only appears once in the document, *OR* most/every detection of multiple entities is equally important to the business process (may often be the case! E.g. on forms or other well-structured use cases) *AND*\n",
    "    - Errors in OCR transcription or the heuristic rules to group matched words together are rare enough *or unpredictable enough* that there's no value in a confidence-score-based review (E.g. if \"The OCR/business rules aren't making mistakes very often, and even when they do the confidence is still high - so our online review isn't helping these issues\")"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this worked example we showed how advanced, open-source language processing models specifically tailored for document understanding can be integrated with [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/): providing a trainable, ML-driven framework for tackling more niche or complex requirements where Textract's [built-in structure extraction tools](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/features/) may not fully solve the challenges out-of-the-box.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying principle of the model - augmenting multi-task neural text processing architectures with positional data - is highly extensible, with potential to tackle a wide range of use cases where joint understanding of the content and presentation of text can deliver better results than considering text alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrated how an end-to-end process automation pipeline applying this technology might look: Developing and deploying the model with [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), building a serverless workflow with [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and driving quality with human review of low-confidence documents through [Amazon Augmented AI](https://aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai/).\n",
