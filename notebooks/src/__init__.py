"""Amazon Textract + LayoutLM model training and inference code for SageMaker

This __init__ file is not necessary for training or inference in sagemaker (which runs your
nominated entry point file, rather than importing this whole folder as a module) - but it can help
with local debugging, by enabling you to `from src import XYZ` from the notebooks.
