    "This pre-training doesn't directly teach the model to perform the target task (classifying entities), but forces the core of the model to learn intrinsic patterns in the data. When we then replace the output layers and **fine-tune** towards the target task with human-labelled data, the model is able to learn the target task more effectively.\n",

    "By default, for speed, the configuration below will use a public pre-trained model from the [Hugging Face Transformers Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=layoutxlm).

If you're interested in pre-training your own models from scratch rather than continuation, please let us know on the [existing GitHub issue thread](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-textract-transformer-pipeline/issues/19).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Unlike real-time endpoints (at the time of writing), asynchronous endpoints can [auto-scale down to zero instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/async-inference-autoscale.html). This can offer substantial cost savings if your business process is low-volume and often idle: With the trade-off that overall process latency may increase, especially for cold-start requests.\n",
    "1. Asynchronous inference can support longer timeouts and larger request/response payload sizes than real-time: Which can be useful in cases where an individual document may be long and take a significant time to process with a model.\n",
    "    - While you can work around the payload size restriction in real-time endpoints by accepting and returning JSON pointers to S3 objects, instead of passing large payloads inline, the inference time-out could still become an issue for particularly heavy requests\n",
    "\n",
    "To deploy our model to an asynchronous endpoint ready to integrate to the OCR pipeline stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "- As detailed in the [SDK docs](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#sagemaker-asynchronous-inference), the optional `async_inference_config` parameter tells SageMaker that the endpoint will be asynchronous rather than real-time.\n",
    "- For permissions integration, our async endpoint will need to store its outputs in the proper S3 location the pipeline is expecting (`output_path`). We can look that up from here in the notebook via the same SSM-based `config` we've seen before.\n",
    "- To resume the pipeline when the model processes a document, our endpoint will need to notify the pipeline's SNS topic. Again, this is given on `config`.\n",
    "- While the *SageMaker* limits on request/response size and response timeouts are higher for asynchronous endpoints than real-time, we need to also make sure the serving stack *within the container* is configured to support very large payloads. Setting the `MMS_*` environment variables below prevents errors related to this. For more information see the [AWSLabs Multi-Model Server configuration doc](https://github.com/awslabs/multi-model-server/blob/master/docs/configuration.md) and corresponding page [for TorchServe](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#other-properties)."

If an inference takes more than ~30s to complete, check the endpoint logs from your [SageMaker Console Endpoints page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?#/endpoints) to see if your request resulted in an error."
